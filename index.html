		<h1>RHYYY!!!</h1>
		<p>Halooo my Little Rhy! Gulat ka noh, andito ka HAHAHAHAHHA. But anyway, before I start, please do understand po that I'm not expecting anything from you in return, and my intention is simply to express my feelings honestly. For these past few weeks, I've found myself drawn to you in a way I can't fully explain. There's just something about your presence :> I want you to know lang din po na I'm not writing this para ma-pressure or i-manipulate you to feel the same way towards me. I believe that emotions are personal and often beyond our control. It's perfectly okay if you don't share the same romantic feelings towards me, you have your reasons, pero umaasa parin ako 😝😝. My purpose in sharing this is to be open and honest with you tho alam mo naman nayan kasi nagsabi na ako sayo nung madaling araw. But, regardless of how you may feel, I want you to know that I genuinely appreciate the moments we've spent together and the conversations we've had, and such. Please understand that my confession doesn't change anything between us unless you want it to, sabi ko sayo diba? Na whatever your decision is, I'll fully respect and support it. You mean a lot to me, and I would be more than happy to continue sharing moments, laughter, conversations, and experiences with you, as we have been doing alr. Others may adore you for your appearance and talents, pero ganon din naman ako hehe. But, my admiration for you grows beyond skin deep and all those achievements, I like you for who you are and everything that comes within you to the point na I just wish you could see yourself the way I view you because I know that you never seem to be satisfied with yourself even though you worked so hard, did your best and remained strong throughout everything you went through. I just hope you know how much I appreciate you and value you because you are one of the best person that I have in my life. I want to thank you for being one of the reasons why I didn't want to give up on things that I've been meaning to do. I hope you know that you are the only person I trust and that you being there for me when everything feels heavy or whenever I am sad is enough for me to continue living this fcked up life HAHAHAHHAA. Thank you Rhy, for being my comfort person, you've helped me get through some tough times without you even knowing how much those help me. You've been there listening to my rants and struggles without you invalidating my feelings, unlike them :>. I really value and appreciate you more than you'll ever imagine, and if at some point that I'm gonna lose you, which is ayaw ko. I would still be grateful. Because once upon a time, I had you by my side, and that's all that matters. Remember, even when you feel alone and the world weighs heavy on your shoulders, I will always be here for you. Hindi mo kailangang maghanap ng ibang kakapitan dahil handa akong maging lakas mo. Kapag parang kulang ang mundo, ako ang pupuno ng mga puwang na yon para sa'yo. Kapag hindi nila kayang maibigay mga needs mo, tandaan mo na lagi akong nandito. Hindi ako aalis, I'll be the one that will stay, if they leave you. I'm not perfect, I'm well aware of that, pero kahit na ganon, kahit na anong mangyari, ang mahalaga, nandito ako. Kaya, kapag may mga pagkakataong parang ang bigat na ng mundo, remember you're not alone, nandito ako, I'm more than ready to hug you, listen to you, be your crying shoulder, and even your strength. Just incase no one has told you this lately, you did so well and I'm superduperultramega proud of you my Little Rhy! When you're ready, just come find me :></p>
